**X-Shift** is a population-finding algorithm that processes large datasets using fast kNN estimation of cell event density; it automatically arranges populations by a marker-based classification system ([Samusik et al. (2016) Nature Methods, 13(6), 493â€“496.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3863)).

**VorteX** is a graphical tool for cluster analysis of multiparametric datasets in biology, especially single-cell data.
